#X text 44 40 A declare object adds one or more directories to the
search path \, and/or pre-loads one or more libraries ("extensions")
to Pd in preparation for opening the patch from a file. Usage is "declare
[-flag value] [-flag value] ..." where the flag can be:;
#X text 40 182 -lib;
#X text 40 198 -stdlib;
#X text 40 146 -path;
#X text 40 162 -stdpath;
#X text 138 199 load a library \, relative to Pd;
#X text 138 163 add to search path \, relative to Pd;
#X text 43 546 BUG: The name "-stdpath" is confusing \, as it has a
quite different effect from "-stdpath" on the pd command line.;
#X text 39 293 For instance \, if you put abstractions and/or other
supporting files in a subdirectory "more" \, you can put an object
\, "declare -path more" to make sure Pd sees them when the patch is
loaded. Or \, if you have files installed in the directory extra/stillmore
(in the Pd installation) you can get it using "declare -stdpath stillmore".
;
#X text 41 397 WARNING: as of version 0.47 \, "declare -path" and "declare
-stdpath" inside abstractions take effect only within those abstractions.
If pd's compatibility version is set to 0.46 or earlier the old (buggy)
behavior takes effect.;
#X text 328 589 updated for Pd version 0.48-1;
#X text 138 146 add to search path \, relative to the patch or user
paths;
#X text 138 182 load a library \, relative to the patch or user paths
;
#X text 40 231 (For any of these you may use a full pathname such as
"/tmp/dir" or \, in Windows \, "C:/garbage" instead of a relative path).
;
#X text 42 469 As of verion 0.48-1 \, "declare -path" and "declare
-lib" will fall back to user search paths if the relative path to the
patch does not exit. To avoid checking \, use an explicit relative
path by prepending "./" to the path or lib name.;

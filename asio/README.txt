In order to build ASIO support into Pd on Windows, you need to download the
ASIO sources from Steinberg directly.  Their license does not let us
redistribute their source files.

- Download the ASIO SDK https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developer.html

- Uncompress asiosdk2.3.zip (or higher) into pure-data/asio

- remove the version number from the folder so that you get pure-data/asio/ASIOSDK

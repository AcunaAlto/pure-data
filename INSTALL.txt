Quick compilation instructions for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows if you have
installed MinGW or Cygwin: make sure "automake" is installed as well as the usual C
compiler chain. Then in this directory, run the following commands:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

If you need jack support, add the corresponding flag to "configure":

    ./configure --enable-jack

See the ./configure help print for other options such as a multi architecture
(universal) build, etc:

    ./configure --help

Alternatively, you can use the fallback makefiles in "src" for GNU/Linux, Mac
OS X, or Microsoft Visual C. On Linux, for example, cd to src and type "make -f
makefile.gnu" and (if you wish) "sudo make -f makefile.gnu install".

Special instructions for Microsoft Visual C: cd to src and type "make -f
makefile.msvc". Then cd to the various subdirs of extra and type "make pd_nt" in
each.

Various dependencies:

- in Linux and Mac you need Tcl/Tk
    (apparently always present for Mac and usually there for Linux).

- On Linux you may also need:
    - the ALSA "dev" package: (yum install alsa-lib-devel) or (sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev)
    - the JACK "dev" package: (yum install jack-audio-connection-kit-devel) or (sudo apt-get install libjack-dev) or (sudo apt-get install libjack-jackd2-dev)
    - libtool (sudo apt-get install libtool)
